# Work Day Scheduler
Module5challenge 

# Description 

My inspiration for this project was to create a simple calendar web application.  The calender application allows a user to save events from 9am-5pm. This application will run in the browser and will feature updated HTML and CSS powered by jQuery. The starter code uses Day.js library to work with the date and time.

# Usage 

The webpage begins with a displayed daily planner once fully loaded.  User can add important events to their schedule to help them manage their time effectively. The planner has time blocks for standard business hours of 9am-5pm.  Each time block is color-coded to indicate whether the event is in the past(gray), present(red), and future(green).  User needs to click into the text area of the time block and enter an event. Once this is completed, user needs to click the save button for that specified time block. The event will be saved even when the webpage reloads.
